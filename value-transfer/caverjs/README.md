# This is for testing service chain value transfer.

## Bash environment variables in config/setting.env
- The *bridgeInfo* variable sets a bridge-info.json file. The bridge-info.json is located config directory. It was generated by [make-bridge-info.sh](../../servicechain-docker/bridge-info/make-bridge-info.sh) 
- The *parentBuildPath* variable sets the build directory where the bin and abi files are located. This build directory is for parent chain.
- The *childBuildPath* variable sets the build directory where the bin and abi files are located. This build directory is for child chain.
- The *deployBridgeConfig* variable sets a deploy-bridge.json file. This deploy-bridge.json file is automatically generated by deploy-contracts.sh.

## Node.js Version
- Used node version as v12.22.10
```shell
nvm use v12.22.10
yarn install
```

## ERC-20 & ERC721
- The wallet/run-value-transfer.sh script executes scripts erc20-transfer-1step.js and erc20-transfer-2step.js in sequence.
- This examples shows when parent chain's alice send tokens to child chain's same alice.
- Also, this examples shows when child chain's bob send tokens to parent chain's same bob.
- 
- One-step uses requestValueTransfer() function. Two-step uses approve() and requestERC20Transfer() functions.

```shell
cd value-transfer/wallet
sh run-value-transfer.sh
```
